    <h1>The Jungle Queen </h1>
    <p>One day the queen thought of getting a new crown for herself. She had ordered the crown to be loaded with precious jewels. So she was busy all day shopping for her new crown. Merchants and traders came from distant lands to offer their best jewels to the queen. So she was busy shopping for her stone-studded crown all day long. The king stayed back at the palace the whole day. 
Later, the king and the queen sat down to dine together. The queen was so tired that she almost dozed off when the dessert was served, and there was ice cream all over her face. So, she knew it was bedtime for her. She said to the king, “Good night dear.” and went to bed. </p>
